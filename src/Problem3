Steps:
    1. Choose a pivot. The method of choosing a pivot for this example will be selecting the median between the
    first, middle, and last value of the list.
    List: [-5, 4, 2, 619, 11, 5, 620, -3]
    Possible pivot values: [-5, 619, -3]
    Pivot: -3

    2. Create two index variables (they will be referred to as lowIndex and highIndex) to point at the lowest
    index and highest index respectively.
    * lowIndex will be represented by parentheses, and highIndex will be represented by asterisks.
    List: [(-5), 4, 2, 619, 11, 5, 620, *-3*]

    3. Compare the lowIndex value to the pivot.
    Comparison: -5 < -3

    4. If the lowIndex value is lower than the pivot, increment lowIndex. If the value is equal to the pivot,
    it can be decided whether it is incremented.
    * In this example, equal values will be considered the same as being lower values.
    List: [-5, (4), 2, 619, 11, 5, 620, *-3*]

    5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the lowIndex value is greater than (or equal to) the pivot or until lowIndex
    is greater than highIndex.
    Comparison: 4 > -3

    6. Compare the highIndex value to the pivot.
    Comparison: -3 = -3

    7. If the highIndex value is higher than the pivot, decrement highIndex. If the value is equal to the pivot,
    it can be decided whether it is incremented.
    No decrement.

    8. Repeat steps 6 and 7 until the highIndex value is less than (or equal to) the pivot or until highIndex is
    less than lowIndex.
    No repetition since the highIndex value is considered less than the pivot.

    9. If highIndex is not decremented (its value is considered to be lower than the pivot) and is greater than
    lowIndex, swap lowIndex and highIndexes' values.
    List: [-5, (-3), 2, 619, 11, 5, 620, *4*]

    8. Repeat steps 5 and 8 until the lowIndex is greater than the highIndex.
    Completing step 5...
    List: [-5, -3, (2), 619, 11, 5, 620, *4*]
    Completing step 8...
    List: [-5, *-3*, (2), 619, 11, 5, 620, 4]

    9. Partition the list into two where one list contains the values from the 0th index to the highIndex and
    the other list contains the rest.
    * The vertical bar will indicate where the list is partitioned.
    List: [-5, *-3*, | (2), 619, 11, 5, 620, 4]

    10. Repeat steps 1 through 10 for both partitions unless the partition has one or zero elements (it is
    considered sorted).
    * For ease of reading, the partitions will be separated into different lists contained in a shared list, but
    it is not actually being done this way. Additionally, it will not be done in the order at which the code may
    do it for ease of writing.
    Partitions (of the list): [-5, -3], [2, 619, 11, 5, 620, 4]
    Iterations after each partitioning:
        a. [pivot: -3: [-3], [-5]], [pivot: 4: [2, 4], [11, 5, 620, 619]]
        b. [[-3], [-5]], [[pivot: 2: [2], [4]], [pivot: 11: [11, 5], [620, 619]]]
        c. [[-3], [-5]], [[[2], [4]], [[pivot: 5: [5], [11]], [pivot: 619: [619], [620]]]
    List: [-3, -5, 2, 4, 5, 11, 619, 620]
