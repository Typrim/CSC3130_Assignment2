I rank these sorting algorithms from fastest to slowest in the following order:
    1. Merge sort
    2. Shell sort
    3. Selection sort
    4. Quicksort
    5. Insertion sort
    6. Bubble sort
Explaining from slowest to fastest, I will start with bubble sort.

Bubble sort is placed last as it is Theta(n^2), which is the least optimal in this entire list.

Insertion sort is placed 5th while not being listed as a tie with bubble sort because it is Omega(n). Despite
that insertion sort is O(n) like bubble sort if insertion sort is not being used on a nearly sorted array, this
slight advantage in its best case scenario puts it over bubble sort.
